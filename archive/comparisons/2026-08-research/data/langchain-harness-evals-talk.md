## Introduction

harnesses. I think this is a very important topic. A lot of you are thinking through building your
own harnesses right now. Um, I'm very excited to introduce Harrison. I first noticed Harrison on
Twitter in 2022 back in the GPT3 era. And Harrison was one of the first people thinking about, okay,
we have these models. How can we build an entire harness around them so that they're not just um
autocomplete uh tasks, but that they start acting as virtual collaborators or agents? Um, and
Harrison like the ecosystem has grown so much since 2022 and I've seen you you also grow a lot in
terms of how you think about building agents, building harnesses, how to eval them, etc. Um, so I'm
very excited to have you talk today. I think the talk is going to be both about harnesses and evals
and then format again will be 15 minutes or so of presentation com content uh 15 minutes of Q&A.
Thanks for joining us Harrison.

## The three parts of an agent: harness, model, context

Cool. Um, my name is Harrison, co-founder, CEO of Langchain. I want to talk about evals and harnesses
in the context of kind of owning your own intelligence.

So, when we talk about intelligence, we're normally talking about agents. What exactly makes up an
agent? At Lingchain, we think there's kind of like three main parts. There's a harness that
orchestrates, a model, and some context. And if you're talking about owning your intelligence in
general, you probably want to own all three parts of these.

And so, owning the model, I'm not going to talk too much about. Lynn was here from fireworks and
talking about open weight models and owning that. A big part of this is also the ability to switch
models. Uh there used to be this concept of kind of being like cloud agnostic and being able to
switch clouds uh back in the day. Same thing exists but for models. You want to be able to switch to
avoid lockin but also to just use the best model when it's available.

Context. You want to own all the the context that your agent uses. Whether that is memory, uh
whether that is semantic knowledge, um whether that is previous conversations, the can these can
help personalize and guide the agent as it goes along. And then the last bit is the harness. And
that's what I really want to focus on. So how how do you how do you really own your harness? What
does that even mean? What's the main job of a harness? The main job of a harness is to bring context
to the model at the right point in time.

## What a harness actually does

And so it does all the orchestration around the the fixed context, the the dynamic context. It
brings it into the context window of the model, shows it something, gets some response, and then
does something with that.

And so agents need to do all these different things in order to accomplish their jobs. There's a ton
of domain specific stuff that they need to do as well, but they need to interact with external
systems. These external systems, when you interact with them, they emit more context that can get
fed back into the agent and into the loop. And so the harness is the thing that really orchestrates
all of this together.

agents at [snorts] their their kind of like simplest. When everyone talks about agents, what they
really talk about is just an LLM running in a loop calling tools. Um, and this this is a really
simple but really general architecture. Some request comes in the the LLM makes some uh uh
generation. That generation may include a tool to call. If it does, you invoke those tools and you
pass that observation back to the LM. And and this is this is the core architecture behind pretty
much every agent out there today. but they're all different in like slightly different ways. And so
on the left here, this is kind of like uh the the the base core kind of like loop, but there's a
bunch of different things that you can do in your particular harness at different stages.

## Customizing the core loop with middleware

And so this is uh over here this is so so we build lang chain which is a really really base minimal
harness and that's lang chain over here. And then this is deep agents. Deep agents is kind of like
our model agnostic and and more general purpose version of of cloud code. And so it does more
things. It connects to file systems. Uh it has skills. It has sub aents. It's built on top of this
really simple harness, but we customize it by using these uh these levers over here. So you can run
particular code snippets before the agents invoked before each model call. You can kind of like wrap
these model calls. You can wrap the tool calls. And you can and you can customize this core uh
simple loop in a lot of really powerful ways just by just by using kind of like small what we call
kind of like middleware constructs.

There's other ways to customize the harness as well, but this has kind of emerged as uh there's a
concept of hooks and plugins and a lot of the coding agents as well. And that's essentially what
they're doing. They're taking this base loop that's running and they're adding little hooks or
plugins at various points to let you customize it.

## Sandboxes, file systems, sub-agents, summarization

And so a lot of the stuff that you can do and you can customize this is all done by that concept of
middleware by just modifying that core loop. So the agent's still running in a loop. It's still
doing that same simple architecture but through that you can give it access to a sandbox. You can
give it access to a file system. You can give it access to sub aents. You can give it access to to
memory. You can have summarization. So summarization if if if we go back to this thing summarization
would come in before the model. before the model's invoked, you check if the context is too long and
then you summarize it. And so that that you can add into this core loop through this concept of
middleware. Same with context offloading um which which is a way of basically taking large tool
calls and dumping them that kind of wraps the tool call. And so the point is there there's this
really simple kind of like general architecture of an agent. All of these more advanced agent
harnesses are basically doing that loop but adding in a bunch of stuff while still running this core
loop. And so as you think about kind of like building or customizing your own harness, these are the
different places that you can insert things into. You can add your own summarization step. You can
add your own handling of particular tool calls. And that's one way that you can customize kind of
like the agent to your particular domain and the harness to your particular domain.

## Cognitive architectures — and when you still need them

The other way that you can customize the harnesses that the agent runs in is by having a more
explicit kind of like cognitive architecture. So this used to be the way that a lot of people would
build agents in kind of 2023 2024 because the models weren't good enough to run in a loop. And so in
order to get it to do particular things, you would have these very bespoke cognitive architectures.
And so this one over here is uh for a deep research example um where it would generate some some sub
questions, fan them out, and then go and execute them. And then this one over here is for a code
review bot. And you can see that there's these very kind of like bespoke steps. A lot of this has
gone into the harness now. And by the harness, I mean it's still this core loop. These might be
added as particular kind of like modifications to that core loop. But for a lot of really particular
kind of like flows, we do see people still using cognitive architectures like these to really guide
it in particular ways.

One thing that we recommend to people is to start with a general harness. That's the easiest to get
started. that it's going to be quickest to time to value. And then as you kind of narrow in on the
use case that you want to be excellent at, you can start to add more of these kind of like gates and
checks around it to to to guide it into particular ways.

## Build your own harness or use off the shelf?

One question that we get a lot is when to kind of think about building your own harness versus using
an off-the-shelf harness. Um, a lot of the off-the-shelf harnesses are uh work with particular
models. So the off-the-shelf harnesses uh include things like cloud code or cloud agent SDK which
works with anthropic models, codeex which works with open AI models. I think this is a big open
question in the industry. My answer generally is the more in distribution you are of what the models
are trained on then the better the off-the-shelf harness will be. As soon as you start to move
further and further out of distribution, then the then you'll probably want to tune your harness in
some way.

There's different ways to tune the harness as well. So the models may be in distribution on
particular things that you are doing on an outofdri like like legal AI which Gabe just talked about
and I think he mentioned how they have their own harness there are things that are in legal AI that
are still in distribution of the the the main models. So for example editing files is something that
the main models have all been RLED on and they've actually all been RL in very particular ways. So,
OpenAI and and claude models edit files in in different ways in their harnesses and as a result,
their models are actually best at editing files in different ways. Now, the the models themselves are
out of distribution on this larger task of legal AI, but they're in distribution on this task of
editing files.

## In-distribution vs. out-of-distribution: the file-editing example

So if you think about building a harness that works there, you'll probably want a custom harness, but
you'll want it to use the edit file tool that is in distribution for uh the the the model that you're
using. So one of the things we do in deep agents for example, so deep agents is our customizable
harness. We actually have this concept of model profiles where for things that are in distribution of
models like editing files, we basically switch between different edit file implementations depending
on which model is being used. And so I think that's an example of customizing the overall harness
when it's out of distribution for a task, but keeping smaller in distribution parts as close to the
model layer as as possible.

The second big part of what I want to talk about is evaluability.

And so I think as you're experimenting with all parts of an agent, whether it's the model or the
harness or the context, you're going to want to know what's going on inside of this system, and
you're going to want to be able to evaluate it. And so these are useful tools that you can use again,
not just for custom harnesses, but also for custom models.

## Why evals define what "good" means in an organization

So there was a great uh Twitter article that Satcha wrote uh two weeks ago um where he talked about a
lot of these concepts, and there's three quotes in particular that kind of stood out for me. One,
create your private evals because eval defines what good looks like inside the organization. Two,
retain ownership of your organization's memory, traces, feedback, that bold is mine, decisions, and
institutional context. And then three, you create your own continuous learning loop, hill climbing
machine that will allow your AI investments to compound the value of your firm. And so I think these
speak to the importance of evals and observability and the learning loop that they power in in really
owning your intelligence and compounding it.

So how exactly do they do that? So eval Gabe was here talking about how they built benchmarks for uh
the legal domain. I think every company when they're building a mission critical agent they will
build benchmarks for that agent. um you can use it to define and catch regressions or you can hill
climb on that benchmark again either by adjusting the harness or adjusting the model

that we see becoming the industry standard for defining these benchmarks is Harbor. Harbor is an
open- source eval runner. It's uh created by the makers of terminal bench 2 which is one of the
industry standard benchmarks for benchmarking coding agents and it's become pretty popular for a
variety of domains. what it lets you do. So this is so this is Frontier Bench which is another uh
coding benchmark. You get this nice benchmark and you can compare different agent harnesses,
different models, different reasoning efforts and you can get this nice benchmark and you can see how
all these different harnesses and all these different models do on your task.

## Harbor: what an eval task actually looks like

And so having a benchmark for your task will become really really important when you're trying to
define it.

What exactly is harbor? It's pretty simple. At a high level, it consists of agent. You you run an
agent against a data set. A data set has a bunch of different tasks. Generally, they're run in
sandboxes because they are a lot of these different tasks and you might want to parallelize them. And
as we talk, as I'll talk about in a little bit, each task has its own kind of like environment. So,
this is what a harbor task looks like. So, on the right, you can see that it has an environment. This
is where you define the environment that the agent runs in. A lot of these longer running, more
stateful agents need to interact with their environment. And so you basically spin up a sandbox, give
it its own environment that's defined in a docker file and run it there. There's then a solution
which is basically this this is a kind of like golden solution that you use to sanity check it. So
it's not that interesting. Tests is more interesting. This is basically the verifier for the the agent
run. The test scripts can do anything. They can run code. They can run unit tests. They can run
another LM as a judge. They can run an agent as a judge. You basically define how the agent is scored
in this test and then instruction.mmd is the prompt that the agent is given and that's kind of like
the core of harbor.

## Comparing harnesses and models on accuracy, latency, and cost

You define these tasks which are bundled up things that can be run in a sandbox and then you run a
bunch of them against agents and agents again consist of models and harnesses and you score how how
they do.

When you do all of that, what do you get? You get some nice results that you can compare. So this is
Langmith the the platform that we build for eval and observability. So you can see here a bunch of
different experiments. Uh we have a great integration with Harbor. You can see the the feedback
scores. In this case, it's a single reward function. You can also track latency and tokens. So when
you're benchmarking agents, you probably don't just care about accuracy. You also probably care about
latency and and and cost. And so you'll want to track all of those. And then for a particular
experiment that you run, these these would be the different tasks that are in a in in a harbor data
set.

talking about a little bit about observability. Uh, observability sounds basic, but I think it's
really important and really underrated for agents actually. So, when agents mess up, they mess up
because an LM call goes wrong. Why might it go wrong? It might go wrong for one of two reasons. One,
the model is not good enough. Two, the context that the LM received isn't good enough.

## Why observability is underrated — it's usually the context

And so, I actually think it's the the second one that more often than not causes issues. And so
having really good observability into what is going into the context window of the the model and then
how that context is accumulated, what steps were run, what tools were run, how does that context get
there? All of that is really important for debugging your agent when it when it goes wrong.

So this is one view of observability that we have. This is intended to be a more kind of like uh
userfriendly view where we actually represent it. This is similar to what you might see in kind of
like cloud code. we we kind of like hide some of the tool calls. So you can see seven tool calls up
there. Um and so we try to make it really easy to kind of like skim through this. Most agent paths
these days come in the form of trajectories. Trajectories are basically you can think of them as the
list of messages that you see kind of like cloud code running. So when you run cloud code or another
agent, you type in a human message. It then makes a bunch of tool calls. Those are all messages under
the hood and then it responds and then you type in another human message. that's kind of like this
message trajectory that is becoming more and more of a central part of of these agents, but that's
not enough to fully debug it. And so we also have this full kind of like uh trace and you can click
into particular things and see exactly what goes on inside the model.

## The data flywheel: traces → curation → experiments

And this type of observability is pretty important for knowing what's going on.

Evals and observability really let you set up this data flywheel and compound the intelligence uh as
you as you start to use the agent as your users start to use the agent and you start to get feedback.

So this is uh this is a slide that one of our team members presented at uh Swix's AI engineering fair
actually around a recipe for continuously improving agents. Um at a high level it's really simple.
You build an agent, you start running it, you collect lots of traces, you then curate the trace data,
and then you run experiments on on that data that you create. And so it's really simple. Um, but of
course there's a lot of complexity under the hood. Um, so so one thing that's really important for
this is is feedback. Getting feedback either from the environment or from a synthetic source. So from
the environment, one thing that I think is really underestimated in agent design is actually UX design
of how you present the agent to your users. If you present it in a really intelligent way, you can
actually end up getting a lot of feedback from them. They may not click thumbs up or thumbs down
explicitly. No one really doing that. But if you if you design the UX in a clever way, you can get
some of that feedback.

## Getting feedback through UX design and online evaluators

The other thing you can do is you can start to get uh synthetic feedback. So you can run what we call
kind of like online evaluators over these traces to judge things. So Gabe was talking about an
experiment that we did with Harvey where we we significantly reduce the cost of of some of these LLM
as a judge type things. So if you imagine running opus over every single trace that comes into your
system, that's going to rack up a big bill. And so you want a really cheap and fast way of doing this.
So we've fine-tuned some SLMs for actually doing this, but you can of course use off-the-shelf models
with custom prompting to do it. Or you can just use code if some of the things that you want to test
are are simple enough.

Um so this is the the the full part of it. Um the curating the trace data feedback is a big part
there. And then the other thing is is when you use that data to update what happens. You can update
any part of the agent with this with this kind of like system. Um so you can update the harness by
doing harness engineering. You can update the model by do by doing fine-tuning on that. You can update
the context by doing memory. Um and and so the part that we are that we think most about at Langchain
is the harness engineering part of that.

## Demo: LangSmith Engine

And so I want to show a really quick demo of of one of the things that we added to help with that. But
I I think trajectory is talking next on some fine-tuning that can be done. Uh and and so it's a very
similar process where you run the agent, get some traces, use that data in some way to improve the
system. What is the system? It's these three pieces and each of them can be updated in some way.

Um and so yeah, this is the full endto-end um uh uh flow that you might want to do. One of the things
that we think about is how can you automate this as much as possible because this is tricky and takes
a lot of time. Um and so that's one of the things that we've been thinking about for the past few
months. I want to do a quick demo of what we call lang engine uh which is basically an agent that sits
on top of your traces and does all this work. So if we look at what that work was, you know, you've
got these traces. It's it the work from there is curating the traces and running some experiments and
suggesting fixes to one of the three things. And as I mentioned, we mostly focus on the harness
engineering bit. Um so uh in the demo I want to show uh what this looks like and how it represents
that. So hopefully this will work. If not, it's not that big of a deal.

Perfect. Okay. So this is Langmith. This is a bunch of traces we have coming in. Um we have this tab
called engine over here. Um this is an agent. It runs in the background. It creates what we call kind
of like issue board. So this is the part of curating data. It will look for it will it will it
basically under the hood is a coding agent that has access to our linksmith CLI. The linksmith CLI you
can filter traces for feedback and other things like that. So we give it a nice big prompt and some
sub aents that help it basically go out and explore this data and identify issues and see what common
things are. And then it will create these issues right here. And so here um it's created an issue. So
it gives a description of it. It has it links to the traces so I can go see some supporting evidence.
And then down here I guess this is very simple changes to the prompts. Um but here it's updating part
of uh the context in this case. Um here it's also updating some instructions. Um and we can see here
that it's adding uh some code to go into the harness as well. And so this is uh something we launched
in the past few uh uh months and I think speaks to this data flywheel which again is a very simple
thing. Run agent, get traces, see patterns, fix um and and this is our attempt at automating it. Um
that's all I've got. Happy to take any questions on harnesses or evals.

## Q&A: Running Engine on Engine, and "codex-ification"

Um this is great by the way. I really appreciate the whole whole presentation. Uh engine itself is an
agent, right? That's given a prompt and go search over things. Uh have you run engine on engine?

We have it running. Yeah. So we get SL so engine also hooks up to slack and sends it kind of like
reports about itself. Um and yeah, that's how we that's how we dog food it. Yeah, we also uh we also
created uh uh what we call kind of like issue bench for engine, which again is like a harbor formatted
uh uh benchmark basically that we're constantly benchmarking different models and different harnesses
on. Um and so it's I think Gabe talked about this a little bit, but one of the benefits of having a
benchmark is you can you can benchmark it on a bunch of different harnesses and see what they're good
and bad at. So we we uh I think a few weeks ago we ran uh our own kind of like deep agents and then
codeex and then claude code on this and we saw that codeex was doing a really interesting thing where
it would write itself a bunch of small scripts to run against these traces and it was doing that
really aggressively and actually allowing it to perform really well. So we we did a sprint to do what
we call the kind of like codeex codeexification of engine and basically take that learning and and
bring it into kind of like the the core engine harness. And so I think that's another uh benefit of
having a benchmark is you can just run a bunch of different things on it and see how they actually
perform and then bring those things back into your core kind of like agent harness.

## Q&A: Will harnesses converge or diverge?

Super cool talk. Um to which extent do you think that like harnesses will converge into one thing and
users will be educated to do that and the models will be best for that versus diversifying here? Every
company has their own uh way of doing things uh optimized for them.

Yeah. Yeah. a really good question and one that we think a lot about and um I I chatted with Eno from
factory who also kind of like thinks a lot about this um and I think there there's some stuff we
talked about this um I I think uh I think there's I I think the model I I don't know is the is the
honest answer. I think uh some things that I've seen is that the general purpose harnesses have gotten
good enough to work for a lot of basic tasks at least when you're getting started. So I would
recommend getting started with like an off-the-shelf harness whether it's deep agents or codecs or
cloud code or something like that because I think the models are now good enough and the things that
we've learned about what these makes these models good access to file systems sub agents things like
that those are those those are kind of like good enough. Um, I think we often see that the more out of
distribution you get, the more you're going to want to customize the harness. And it's a scale, right?
So like it uh it it it at the extreme end of a scale, you might want to build a complete kind of like
cognitive architecture that that is really focused on things. A reason another reason you might want
to do that, by the way, is kind of like for predictability and control. And so we have a lot of
customers in financial services where they want where they need kind of like predictability. And so
they we we show them something like deep agents and they're like whoa whoa whoa that's way too like
scary an agent for us. We want like more of this kind of like custom cognitive architecture where we
can really control things. Um but but then on the other end uh you know you could just use an
offtheshelf harness and there's things in the middle like hooks or middleware that you can use to kind
of so so it's a spectrum as well. The more out of distribution you get the more custom harness you're
going to want to have.

Um, and then there's other like weird things where like again like um I I I think uh both OpenAI and
Enthropic are getting really good at coding, but they've landed on different ways to kind of like edit
files um that are like you know that are like actually pretty different. Um Eno had I I think they
have some benchmark and I think he was uh he he thought that one way was just better than the other
way just like strictly superior. Um, and and and so that's like like so I think the model labs will
kind of converge and that they all seem to be kind of like really good at coding. The harnesses will
converge to to kind of like being really good at coding if they keep on going down that path. But at
the same time there are these like really small differences and I don't really know how to explain uh
those either. And um right now I think those show up most concretely in small things, but you could
imagine what what if one lab really goes down kind of like bio and th those harnesses become really
good at kind of like bio agent things. Then then then the harnesses themselves start to diverge and so
um I I don't know is the answer. It's a fastmoving space. That's why eval observability are important
and I think and and I think we yeah to measure all of that.

Cool. Awesome. Thank you guys.
